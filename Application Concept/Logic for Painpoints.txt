Here is the answers for your gap : 
1. Name of the Client, Services Used and therir Email and Whatsapp number we have in the internal system in another google sheet : 
2. Notification delivery system via Whatsapp : 
3. After the drafted notification it should show copy button for review and after copy it should direct them to google review page


This clarifies the architecture significantly. Here's how these requirements change the implementation:

Updated Architecture
1. Client Data Lookup (Cross-Sheet Integration)
Instead of collecting client details in the form, the system will:

Form Submission (Email only as identifier)
         ↓
VLOOKUP to Internal Client Sheet
         ↓
Retrieve: Name, Company, Services, Email, WhatsApp
Implementation Change:

Add a new function lookupClientData(email) that queries your internal Google Sheet
Match on email address (the auto-captured Google account email)
Pull: Client Name, Company Name, Services Used, WhatsApp Number, Business Email
Question: What's the unique identifier to match between the form submission and your internal sheet? Is it the email address, or do you have a Client ID field?

2. WhatsApp Notification Delivery
Instead of email-only, the consent request and final review will be sent via WhatsApp.

Options for WhatsApp Integration:

Method	Complexity	Cost
WhatsApp Business API (Official)	High	~$0.05/message
Twilio WhatsApp	Medium	~$0.005-0.05/message
WhatsApp Click-to-Chat Link	Low	Free (manual)
Recommendation for Phase 1: Use a simple WhatsApp API service like Twilio or a Google Apps Script-compatible service (e.g., CallMeBot, UltraMsg) to send templated messages.

3. Copy Button → Then Redirect to GBP
The UX flow you described:

Client receives WhatsApp message
         ↓
Clicks link → Opens review page
         ↓
Sees drafted review + COPY button
         ↓
Clicks COPY → Text copied to clipboard
         ↓
Automatically redirects to Google Business Profile review page
         ↓
Client pastes and submits
This requires a simple landing page (can be hosted via Google Apps Script Web App) with JavaScript for copy + redirect.

Before I Update the Document
A few quick clarifications:

Once you answer these, I'll update the Implementation Approach document with:

Cross-sheet lookup logic for client data
WhatsApp integration code
Landing page with copy-then-redirect functionality
